# Case Study Assignment

## Overview and Origin

* **Name of Company**

    * R3

* **Inspiration**

    * This company focuses on increasing the level of trust between regulated industries, and consumers. They are a permissioned DLT platform for developing multi-party applications.  The goal is to help establish more digital trust between organizations and consumers.  With the pandemic expediting the progress to digital assets, and the increased investment in digital assets, there needs to be a higher sense of trust from all parties involved.

## Business Activities

* **Financial Problems**

    1. Many parts of the asset lifecycle are highly manual and fragmented. This leads to errors, rising costs, and inefficiencies.
    2. In a global economy, payments heavily rely on account-to-account transfer, which can be slow and expensive.  
    3. Cross-border payments are mitigated by banks in multiple countries.  The process is highly inefficient, and typically are associated with high fees, and a lack of transparency.
    4. Reconciliation is usually labor-intensive and can be sensitive to errors, paritcularly when dealing with a high volume of data.

* **Solution**

    1. Assets are managed in peer-to-peer (P2P) permissioned shared ledger allowing the assets to move easier between involved parties, all while keeping with regulations.
    2. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) aims to deliver real-time person-to-person transfers with an instant settlement.  This allows banks to maintain efficiency, transparency, and monetary policy.
        -examples: Project Jura, Project Dunbar, and Riksbank
    3. Banks can move digital assets directly between entities and acrosss borders. 
    4. Delivers an immutable 'single source of truth' for multiple parties.  Transactions are cryptographically signed and stored by relevant parties, which prevents overexposure of data.

* **Intended Cutomer Base**

    * Banks, corporates, insureres, cloud providers, FMIs (Financial Management Information Systems) and exchanges.
        -Examples: ING, Wells Fargo, AWS, intel, Accenture, MetLife, HSBC, Nasdaq

## Landscape

* **Domain**
    * Open Banking, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
        * Open banking is the practice of allowing third-party financial servcice providers access to a banks consumer data. The use of APIs (application programming interfaces) is, generally, how this is operated. Typically, the third parties are tech startups.  Open banking is moving the banking industry to use networks rather than centralization. This will help sharing financial data much more securely inbetween other financial institutions.
            * source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp
        * Blockchain is a database that is distributed and shared amongst a large computer network.  Shared through nodes, the blockchain stores information digitally.  It maintains a secure, decentralized record of transactions.
            * source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

    * R3 is trying to establish a private DLT for financial institutions and banks.  The company leverages technology to establish higher levels of trust in the growing digital economy.  R3's product, Corda, allows the customer to build applications that are secure, efficient, and transparent. This should be a great solution for customers who are prioritizing these needs in the banking industry.
        * Example - Wells Fargo Digital Cash
            * Running on Wells Fargo's first DLT platform. 
            * Allows for internal book transfers of cross-border payments within its own global network.  the DLT provides a highly secure and trusted record of the transactions. "We believe DLT holds promise for a variety of use cases, and weâ€™re energized to take this significant step in applying the technology to banking in a material and scalable way. Wells Fargo Digital Cash has the potential to enable Wells Fargo to remove barriers to real-time financial interactions across multiple accounts in multiple marketplaces around the world."

## **Results**

* **Impact** 
    * Application builders include DTCC, Wells Fargo, Moneygram, SIX Swiss Exchange and Nasdaq.  These are massive financial players in the global economy.  They are putting their trust and power behind R3 and Corda to build the next generation of security applications in their regulated markets.

    * Guild One and R3
        * GuildOne is an Alberta based company focusing on supplying advaced database solutions and business intelligence to Western Canadian oil and gas industry.  In partnership with AWS, they have created a new solution for royalty contract transactions. Usually, these disputes need lots of general and administrative costs that slow down the process.  Through R3, GuildOne aims to reduce complexities and increase efficiency.

    * R3 Development fund has invested over $10 million in over 20 different startups building apps using their platform.  This fund has expedited product and business development.  They plan to continue their investment strategy into 2022.  The goal of these investments is to expand the adoption of Corda in their core markets.

* Core Metrics
    * Throughput Comparison.  Their newest model, Corda Enterprise 4, has drastically outpaced their previous iteration, Corda Enterprise 3.  On flows completing per second, or transactions per second, Corda 4 was more successful, with 2580 TPS vs 1952 from Corda 3.
    * Corda Enterprise 4 Throughput of Multiple Payments per Transaction becomes more efficient with more output contract states in each transaction.  This is a promising sign for efficient scalability.

* Compared To Competition
    * Digital Assets is a major market player in R3's domain.  They have nearly three times the amount of funds raised, and are lagging behind in the stages of funding.  However, R3 has positioned themselves as a leader in the industry.  By partnering with major market players, such as Amazon, and Wells Fargo, there is a high degree of trust in their product.  They have continued to grow since 2014, and are looking to continue to do so moving forward. 
-----------------------------------------------------

## **Recommendations**

* Advice
    * The company seems committed to providing major institutions in regulated markets their product.  However, by catering to the mass public, they could further integrate their platform with people at home.  Allow individuals to create their own private DLTs for their transactions.  This would create a far more accurate, and transparent record of how individuals behave with digital assets.  While Corda helps facilitate transactions between large institutions, having a product focusing directly on the consumer could create a smoother experience for all parties involved.  Looking forward, it seems as though digital assets are going to play a major factor in the global economy.  By allowing individuals to properly benefit from R3's Corda product, there can be a more efficient and transparent dichotomy between institutions, and consumers.  Building trust in the growing technological evolution is critical, and this would be a great way to further enhance that relationship.
